## Introduction

In a world where we are constantly bombarded with information, the **News Aggregator** helps you stay informed without having to scroll through your social media feeds (thank goodness!). It's like a magic crystal ball that shows you the headlines without any of that pesky effort.

## Features

- **Aggregates news from multiple sources**: Because why would you want to read from just one? You can read the same headline from 50 different angles!
- **Filters by category**: Politics, sports, entertainment—pick your poison!
- **Simple UI**: So simple that even a caveman could use it. Just kidding; cavemen are too busy discovering fire.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository. You can use this overly complicated command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-aggregator.git
